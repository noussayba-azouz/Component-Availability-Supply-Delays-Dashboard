# Overview
This repository features a Power BI dashboard for monitoring component availability and supply delays using anonymized supply chain data. It targets supply chain teams, procurement managers, and manufacturing operations professionals with real-time availability tracking, delay visuals, and product risk analysis.

# Dashboards
- **Component Availability**: Displays summary metrics, product breakdowns with missing components, and filtering options.
- **Supply Delays**: Shows bar charts for delays by supplier and component, plus shortages.
- **Product Details**: Provides drill-down views for individual products, including component quantities, orders, dates, delays, and suppliers.

# Dataset
- **File**: (Assumes connection to external sources like SQL/Excel; sample anonymized data can be integrated)
- **Records**: Variable (based on connected dataset)
- **Columns**: Includes Product, Component, Required Qty, Available Qty, Shortage, Ordered Qty, Expected Reception Date, Delay, Supplier
- **Timeframe**: Dynamic (real-time or historical based on data refresh)
- **Anonymized**: Generic IDs (e.g., SUP00000XX, CP00XX, P10XX), quantities blurred, delays averaged.
